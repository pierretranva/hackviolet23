        Creating your own schedule can be stressful and intimidating, especially when you're a first year. Here are some useful tips and resources to help you get started and build the perfect schedule fit for you. 
        1. After deciding your classes, it's important to research the professors. RateMyProfessor is a popular website used to check different factors about your professors including workload, classroom environment, teaching style, homework/test policies, and more. Often times, students walk into their first day of class blind without knowing this crucial information, and on the off chance you don't get along with you're professor, it's difficult to switch into another section before the add/drop period closes.

        2. With so many classes, it's difficult to plan the times for all your classes. Some might prefer early classes while others afternoon classes. Some might want their classes evenly spaced throughout the week while others might want them crowded in the beginning to leave Friday free. All these options may be overwhelming, but Pschedule is a useful website that can help relieve this stress. After inputing your classes for the semester, PScheduler is able to generate all the different combinations of schedules you could have. You can shuffle through each schedule until you find a one that works for you.
        
        3. Another great website is Anaanu which can be used to check grade records for all your classes. It will list the average GPA in the course along with the grade distribution. In addition, it will list the grade distribution for all the professors teaching the course. Anaanu is great for figuring out your courseload for the semester. This way, you can create a schedule that has a balance between easy and difficult classes.

        4. Navigating Hokie Spa to find your schedule can be inconvienent and annoying. Coursicle is an app that puts all your classes into a timetable and stores information for each class such as the professor, location, time, and course description. It's an easy and accessible way to keep your schedule on your phone, and the blocking layout makes it simply to read.
        
        5. If you're in need of switching to another class or section that's full, CoursePickle is a website that can send you emails or text messages to alert you of an opening in the course. There is a small fee for text messages, but email alerts are completely free and you can sign up for as many classes as you want.
